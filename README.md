GIS Construction web application
Project Mandate:   Develop a GIS web application for Building construction management site wise and floor wise for Commercial or Residential purpose. The essential Requirements need data like Soil Type, Population Density, Transportation etc.
To start up project the first process considers the following main output required.
1.	Survey data
2.	Data conversion CAD to GIS.
3.	GIS application component, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Portal, ArcGIS Server etc.
4.	Create construction buildings layer using ESRI ArcMap.
5.	Public the construction buildings layer at ESRI ArcGIS Server as a Features service layer.
6.	Using .Net Framework creating HTML/ASP.net page.
7.	Using Ajax/C# code consuming Feature’s service layer data and display it on page.
8.	Using ‘esri/dijit/editing/Editor’, We can modify and delete Feature’s service layer using ArcGIS API JavaScript 3x or 4x.

we can also apply Lean Startup method so the Build-Measure-Learn loop pertains to the cyclical process of turning ideas into products, measuring the reactions, response, and behaviors of the customers against the products that have been built, and learning whether to persevere or pivot the idea.Lean Startup is included in the context of combining PRINCE2 with agile, as some of the core concepts and techniques in Lean Startup are fundamental to the most effective way to deliver a product at the end of a timebox or a project. Lean Startup focuses on uncertainty, learning and handling change.

Use the Process at Siso : At Siso we are all about adapting. Instead of having a single cycle approach we use a double cycle approach.
